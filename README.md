# Information Panel
The information panel is mostly based on the python package *dash*. It's used to get the latest information on a certain topic. You are able to use sources like twitter to make semantic analysis and to browse the used sources.

There is currently no stable version available.
version 0.1

Even if the comments, method/function names and identifier are written in the english language, the content
of all pages is and has to be written in the german language, because the main users are only able to understand
the german language and not the english one.
